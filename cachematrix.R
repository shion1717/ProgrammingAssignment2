# The function makeCacheMatrix creates a special object which stores a list of functions to:

# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the inverse of the matrix
# 4. get the inverse of the matrix

# The following function calculates the inverse of the special list created with the above function. 
# However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
# If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
# Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the inverse of the matrix in the cache via the solve function.
